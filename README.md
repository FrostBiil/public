## 🌟 About 

Throughout my journey in software development, I've worked on a variety of projects in **Python**, **C#**, **C++**, **JavaScript/TypeScript**, and more. This repository serves as a record of my learning and accomplishments, showing how my skills have developed over time. From beginner-level programs in high school to complex projects in university and my personal experiments, every project has taught me something valuable.

My goal with this repository is to:
- Document my growth as a developer.
- Share my projects with the community.
- Inspire others to keep learning and experimenting with code.
- Showcase my skills to potential collaborators and employers.

## 🧩 Projects

Below is an overview of some of the projects in this repository. For a complete list, explore the directory structure above or use the `README.md` files within each folder.

### 🐍 Python Projects (Located in python/)
- Currently, there are no published projects in this section, but stay tuned! I'm actively working on exciting projects, and they will be added here soon. 😊

### 🟦 C# Projects (Located in cs/)
- [VR Escape Room](cs/EscapeRoom-main): A virtual reality escape room game built using C#. Players must solve puzzles to navigate and escape a maze, with gameplay inspired by the style of [Portal](https://store.steampowered.com/app/400/Portal/). This game was developed in [Unity](https://unity.com/) as part of a collaborative project with [BapllStar](https://github.com/BapllStar), [Julian33](https://github.com/julian33), [Marcusbandit](https://github.com/marcusbandit), and [Nekoman69](https://github.com/Nekoman69).
  
### 🦖 C++ Projects (Located in `cpp/`)
- **[AxeGame](cpp/AxeGame/)**: A simple game using fundamentals of C++, where you avoid being hit by a ball. The game is made using the library [raylib](https://www.raylib.com/).
- **[Clashy Clash](cpp/AxeGame/)**: An intermidiate game project using C++. The project demonstates the use of abstract classes, pointers, usage of spritesheets and animations. The game is made using the library [raylib](https://www.raylib.com/).
- **[dapper-dasher](cpp/dapper-dasher/)**: A simple game using the basics of C++, here you avoid being hit by nebulas as the character scarfy. The game is made using the library [raylib](https://www.raylib.com/).

### 🌀 JavaScript/TypeScript Projects (Located in `js/`)
- **[Programming B Exam Project](js/ProgrammingBExamProject/)**: A web application similar to GitHub or itch.io, designed for users to publish and share their games. Built using [React](https://react.dev/) with the [Mantine](https://mantine.dev/) library for the UI and [Primsa](https://www.prisma.io/) for the server-side logic. This project was developed in collaboration with another student, [JanuZz](https://github.com/JanuZz), where I primarily contributed to the frontend development.
- **[Space Invaders](js/SpaceInvaders)**: A simple recreation of the classic Space Invaders game, developed as a school project using JavaScript and the [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) library. The game features basic mechanics where players control a spaceship to shoot down incoming enemies. This project helped me explore game development fundamentals, including animation, collision detection, and player controls.

### 🌐 HTML/CSS Projects (Located in HTML/CSS/)
- Currently, there are no published projects in this section, but stay tuned! I'm actively working on exciting projects, and they will be added here soon. 😊

### ☕ Java Projects (Located in java/)
- **[Breakout](java/Breakout)**: A classic brick-breaking game developed in Java as a 3-week university project. It features paddle and ball mechanics, multiple levels, power-ups, and collision handling, with a focus on object-oriented design and game physics. Developed in collaboration with [Bondesgaard](https://github.com/bondegaard), [Skytiger1](https://github.com/skytiger1) & [Lobehjulius](https://github.com/Lobehjulius).
- **[Ninjagame](java/Ninjagame)**: A turn-based combat game designed to implement Test-Driven Development (TDD) using JUnit 4/5. The game follows a structured testing approach to ensure combat logic, enemy AI, and player interactions work as expected.

### 🗃️ SQL Projects (Located in sql/)
- Currently, there are no published projects in this section, but stay tuned! I'm actively working on exciting projects, and they will be added here soon. 😊
