# Programming B, Exam Project
Grade 12 (A)

A brief description of the project.

## Status

**This project can no longer be run.** The required servers or services are no longer active, and the project is non-functional without them.

## About the Project

This project was a TypeScript React application that relied on external servers for its functionality. While the codebase remains intact, its inability to connect to the necessary backend services makes it inoperable.

## Previous Requirements

The project originally required:
- Node.js
- npm or yarn
- A modern web browser

## Why It No Longer Works

The project depended on servers that are no longer active. This means:
- API requests will fail due to unavailable endpoints.
- Backend functionality is not accessible.
- Features relying on server-side operations are broken.

## Next Steps

If you are interested in reviving this project, you could:
1. Rebuild the backend servers.
2. Replace the server dependencies with new services or APIs.
3. Modify the codebase to support a self-contained or alternate functionality.
